#+TITLE: Musicbrainz Datasette Importer

This is a small Python utility to fetch all of the listening history of a single user and store it in an SQLite database so it can be explored for and queried using the fabulous [[https://datasette.io/][datasette]] toolkit. In the end of course it's just an SQLite database, so what you end up doing with it is up to you.

** Roadmap [/]

- [ ] Import listening history of a user
- [ ] Reconcile with existing database
